# Sprite creation and minification of images

- All image sources are stored in `websrc/images` directory.
- Directory `websrc/images/sprite` is designated to store all pictures that should be compiled into single sprite file. Sprite is stored into `websrc\images` root directory.
- All other files in the root of  `websrc/images` or in any of its subdirectories are minified and copied to `www/assets/images` directory.
